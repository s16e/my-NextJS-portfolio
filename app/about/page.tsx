        Hi! I’m
        <span className="text-blue-700">Subash Chandra Bose R</span>, a
        final-year B.Tech student majoring in Information Science and
        Engineering at
        <span className="font-bold">St. Joseph's college of Engineering</span>,
        chennai. I’m passionate about building clean, responsive web
        applications and combining technology with creativity to solve
        real-world problems.
      </div>
      <div className="mx-10 my-2">
        My strengths lie in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and Javascript
        programming. I’m currently learning{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">React</span> and practicing
        <span className="font-bold">DSA</span> to crack top tech interviews.
        Beyond tech, I have a creative side — I’ve worked as a freelance graphic
        designer on Fiverr and collaborated with brands as a content creator,
        leading teams and managing digital campaigns.
      </div>
      <div className="mx-10 my-2">
        I’m actively involved in hackathons, tech events, and coding contests. I
        also love exploring AI prompt engineering, staying up-to-date with new
        tools, and engaging with developer communities.
      </div>
      <div className="mx-10 my-2">
        Whether it’s designing intuitive user interfaces or automating backend
        logic, I believe in building projects that are both functional and
        delightful to use. I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and take on
        exciting challenges!
